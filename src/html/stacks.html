        <p class="card card__text">
          Polygone annotation executed by human data engineers allows extracting
          irregular shapes and coarse, texturized objects from videos and
          photos.

        <p class="card card__text">
          3D cloud annotation is a technique of defining a three-dimensional
          structure of an object in space. Unlike the 3D cuboid tool, point
          cloud one delivers the most accurate results.

          3D cuboid annotation
        </h3>

        <p class="card card__text">
          Cuboid annotation allows building a realistic 3D perception of the
          surrounding. This tool is widely used for mapping, self-driving
          vehicles, object distribution, etc.

          A labeling tool for object detection in pictures, especially if the
          quality of raw materials isn’t perfect. Effectively used for drone
          maps, satellite imagery, and medical data.

          It’s a practice of indicating key points at specific locations of the
          image. It is used to recognize the smallest expressions, gestures, and
          actions of the observed subject, as well as to construct the movement
          trajectory of scenes.
